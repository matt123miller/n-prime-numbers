# n-prime-numbers

This is a .net core project that generates and input `n` prime numbers. I'm using core as I've been meaning to learn it since it was released a few years ago. All my previous C# experience has been using old ASP.NET or for games, so this should be interesting. It will also allow me to learn more about unit testing.


## Notes:
 - [] I remember reading about a mendel sieve algorithm, maybe that's appropriate?
 - [] Write tests first, then write the minimum code required to pass that test.
    - This means adding things like checking for the right sort of input etc. comes AFTER writing the tests for business logic and the code that passes the test.
