# Requirements


## Introduction

Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers. Our hope is that it should only take a couple of hours to build a simple solution. The aim is NOT to see how much you can code in a given time, so feel free to spend as much time as you want to highlight your level of programming.

You must put your code onto GitHub, otherwise we won’t consider it. We will review it from there.

## The requirements

· you can use whatever programming language you like for this exercise - we mainly use Elixir and JavaScript

· Do not use a brute force / trial division algorithm

· Should have a test for a performant prime algorithm that can generate a list of 20,000+ primes

· small commits to git so that we can see how you’ve developed your solution

· write your application with high unit test coverage

· for the input and output you can use the console, a web page, or something else

· please write an algorithm to solve the prime number generation - do not use a library method to generate your primes

· the user should input a whole number N, where is N is at least 1

· the application should output an N+1 x N+1 grid of numbers

Example primes multiplication table when N is 3

| | 2 | 3 | 5 |

| 2 | 4 | 6 | 10 |

| 3 | 6 | 9 | 15 |

| 5 | 10 | 15 | 25 |

Please include a README file that outlines

· how to run it

· what you’re pleased with

· what you would do with it if you had more time

## We will evaluate your submission on

· a performant prime algorithm that can generate very large primes (think in terms of generating excess of 10,000 or 20,000 primes).

· a simple and extensible solution

· code that is easily maintainable

· the formatting of the output

## What we believe in

· a test driven approach

· loosely coupled and highly cohesive design

· perfection is not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away
